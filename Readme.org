This R package lets you call short read aligner tools from the programming and convenience of R console.

The aim of this package would be give programmatic access, and make the sequencing data analysis workflow uniform.

The R functions are asynchronous, it won't clutter your R command line.

** Usage
- Depending on tools, functions are self defined.

*** bwa - Burrows wheeler transform algorithm
-
#+begin_src R
bwaIndex()
#+end_src

** Improvements
- There are lot of room to improve and enhance the best practices.
- As of =0.1= version, package is very basic and is not solving a big problem.
- Thus lots to plans, and todo is shined to broaden the package usage.
- So far, its in the vein of *suckless* philosophy.
